Usage: powermetrics [-d] [-i sample_interval] [-o order] [-t wakeup_cost]

  Gather and display CPU usage statistics (divided into time spent in
  user mode and supervisor mode), timer and interrupt wakeup frequency
  (total and, for near-idle workloads, those that resulted in package
  C-state exits), and on supported platforms, interrupt frequencies
  (categorized by CPU number), package C-state statistics (an indication
  of the time the core complex + integrated graphics, if any, were in
  low-power idle states), as well as the average execution frequency for
  each CPU when not idle.

The following command-line options are supported:

    -h | --help                  show this message

    -s | --samplers <samplers>   comma separated list of samplers and sampler groups

    -b | --buffer-size <size>    set output buffer size (0=none, 1=line)
    -i | --sample-interval <N>   sample every N ms (0=disabled) [default: 5000ms]
    -n | --sample-count <N>      obtain N periodic samples (-1=infinite) [default: -1]
    -t | --wakeup-cost <N>       assume package idle wakeups have a CPU time
                                 cost of N us when using hybrid sort orders
                                 using idle wakeups with time-based metrics

    -o | --order <method>        order process list using specified method [default: composite]
    -f | --format <format>       display data in specified format [default: text]

    -a | --poweravg <N>          display poweravg every N samples (0=disabled) [default: 10]

                                 This implicitly enables sampling of all the
                                 above per-process statistics.
    --show-process-samp-norm     Show CPU time normailzed by the sample window.
    --handle-invalid-values      powermetrics will output invalid=true rather
                                 than abort when it sees invalid values
    --show-all                   Enables all samplers and displays all the
                                 available information for each sampler.

The following sort orders are supported by --order:

    pid         process identifier
    wakeups     total package idle wakeups         (alias: -W)
    cputime     total CPU time used                (alias: -C)
    composite   weighted hybrid of package idle
                wakeups and CPU time used          (alias: -O)

The following output formats are supported by --format:

    text        human-readable text output
    plist       machine-readable property list, NUL-separated

This tool also implements special behavior upon receipt of certain signals
to aid with the automated collection of data:

    SIGINFO                 take an immediate sample
    SIGIO                   flush any buffered output
    SIGINT/SIGTERM/SIGHUP   stop sampling and exit
